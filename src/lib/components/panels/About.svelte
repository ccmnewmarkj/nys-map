		This map of <span style="font-weight: 800;"
			>community media outlets in New York State, north of New York City</span
		>, includes {outletCount}
		outlets that primarily cover communities of color and immigrants. The map accompanies the New York
		State Media Directory, which together serve as a resource for advertisers, journalists, community
		organizers, and others who want to connect with the community media sector in New York State. You
		can see the list of outlets under the <span class="tab">Outlets</span> tab
	</p>
	<p class="callout" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
		For community media outlets in New York City, visit CCM's <a
			href="http://ccm-directory.journalism.cuny.edu">Many Voices, One City</a
		> directory.
	</p>

	<h2>How to use the map</h2>
	<p>
		Select the <span class="tab">Search</span> tab to apply filters that will narrow down the number
		of outlets, whether by community, language or media type. The list of outlets that appear under
		the
		<span class="tab">Outlets</span> tab will update accordingly.
	</p>
	<p class="address-search">
		You can also <span class="tab" style="background-color:transparent; padding:0;"
			>search by address</span
		>
		or city using the search bar. The map will then zoom in to the location, with a <MapPin
			strokeColor="#cc5f02"
		/> marker indicating the spot. To remove the marker, select the "X" in the search bar (which appears
		when you hover over, click or select the box) to clear it.
